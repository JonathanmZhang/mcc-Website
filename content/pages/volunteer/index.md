#### About the Mississauga Chess Club
Mississauga Chess Club, the largest chess club in Canada, is located at 1444 Dundas Crescent, Mississauga. MCC operates on three nights: Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
Tournament games are played weekly.

#### What Our Volunteers Do
Our volunteers help us do many of the tasks that make a chess club possible.
Kids look forward to playing chess each week, and volunteers help make that possible.
Duties include setting up and putting away chess club equipment,
assisting kids and parents, playing and helping kids new to chess.
This is a great opportunity to get some volunteer hours, especially if chess is an interest.

#### Getting Started
We will give hours to high school students completing their 40 hours.
Knowledge of how chess works is not a requirement and we can teach if you are new!

#### Openings
- Monday Nights
- Wednesday Nights
- Friday Nights

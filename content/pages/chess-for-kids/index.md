title: Chess For Kids
---

The Mississauga Chess Club for Kids is a large club where kids play chess every week.
We offer a friendly environment where kids and youth of all ages play each other.
Members range from beginner to intermediate, and advanced players can join our Wednesday club.

We play regular 5 week tournaments (CFC rated) and have fun chess days.

**NEW!** This year, we are offering members **FREE** lessons before and after
the weekly tournament games, starting from 6:30 PM - 7:00 PM and 8:00 PM - 8:30 PM.

We meet on Mondays at Erindale United Church.

### FAQ

#### Q: Is my kid ready for the chess club?
- A: We receive many inquiries asking this question.
  To answer this question, ask you and your child one simple question:
  Does your son/daughter know how the chess pieces move?

  If the answer is YES, we hope to see you next Monday at 6:45pm!

  If the answer is NO, he/she is not ready for the chess club.
  We recommend you sit with your child and visit one of many websites that will teach the basics.
  We recommend this site: [chesskid.com](https://chesskid.com).
  Listen to the 13-minute intro video. Read the accompanying text explaining the rules.
  Then click on 'Play Computer'. Donâ€™t worry about beating the computer,
  the object is to practice moving the pieces. The computer will only allow legal moves.
  Once you get comfortable moving the pieces correctly, you are ready to join the chess club.
  At the chess club, you will play other kids at your skill level.
  You will learn mostly by playing. We do offer some lessons to help you along.
  You will receive a chess rating so you can track your progress.

#### Q: What happens at the club?
- A: At the kids club on Mondays, kids will play a few games each night.
  Most games are 'fun games' which will not be rated and can be played with anyone.
  At around 7:30, the kids will be paired to play a 'tournament game' which will count towards their rating.
  There are two short lessons (30 mins) before and after the games, running
  from 6:30 PM - 7:00 PM & 8:00 PM - 8:30 PM.

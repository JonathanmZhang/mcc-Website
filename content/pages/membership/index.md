### Become a Mississauga Chess Club Member!
The first visit is free, and membership is paid annually from the week you join.

If you want to play in Wednesday tournaments, you must also pay the CFC membership fee (listed below). <br>
For juniors attending the club on Monday and Friday, you are not required to pay the CFC membership fee, but you still need a [CFC ID](https://www.chess.ca/en/players/membership-join/).

title: NM Henry Liu's MCC Story
---

The Mississauga Chess Club (MCC) is the largest chess club in Canada, with over 450 active members. Throughout its history, many chess masters, including GM Razvan Preotu and IM Anthony Atanasov, have begun their chess journeys here. Among them is NM Henry Liu, who grew his chess skills from beginner to National Master and has become a dedicated volunteer, giving back to the community that supported him.<br>

Henry’s chess adventure began at MCC’s old location at the University of Toronto Mississauga campus. The club was a welcoming place for anyone interested in chess, and it was here that Henry first discovered his passion for the game. Surrounded by players of all levels, he quickly absorbed strategies and improved his tactical ability, thanks to the guidance and support of fellow club members.<br><br>
When MCC moved to its current location, Henry continued to play and grow within the club. The friendly competition and encouragement from other members helped him improve quickly. His hard work paid off in 2019 when he earned the title of National Candidate Master. This milestone was a significant achievement, but for Henry, it was also an opportunity to give back to the club that had supported him.<br><br>

Henry started volunteering as a junior coach, dedicating his Monday evenings to help young players develop their skills. He found joy in teaching and saw it as a way to contribute to the community that had given him so much. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when in-person activities were not possible, Henry created the [online MCC club on chess.com](https://www.chess.com/club/the-mississauga-chess-club). With help from a team of volunteers, they organized over 200 online tournaments, ensuring that members could continue to enjoy chess and stay connected.<br><br>

When the club reopened, Henry took on new responsibilities as a webmaster and developer. He updates club content on a weekly basis and is part of the team that developed the club’s new website, which launched in February 2024, making it easier for members to stay informed and engaged.<br><br>
Henry reflects on his journey with gratitude, saying, "It feels great to be part of it. Many juniors begin their chess journey here and benefit greatly from these experiences. Chess is quite a remarkable activity; not only can you improve your general skills, but you also learn how to be resilient, overcome challenges, and perform under pressure. These are great life skills to know."<br><br>
Henry’s story is just one of many at the Mississauga Chess Club. It highlights the spirit of community and volunteerism that defines the club. MCC continues to be a place where people of all ages and skill levels can come together to enjoy chess, learn, and grow. The support and camaraderie found here are what make the club special, and the dedication of volunteers ensures it remains a vibrant and welcoming community for all.<br><br>
MCC heavily relies on volunteers to run, every week we have over a dozen junior volunteers. We welcome all who wish to join us to share their passion for chess and uphold the spirit of community. Together, we continue to make MCC a home for all chess players.

### Introduction

The Mississauga Chess Club is the biggest chess club in Canada with players ranging in strength from beginner to master. All age groups are represented through a youth and adult club. The adult club holds regular tournaments (5' Blitz, 25' + 5s/move Active, 60'+ 30s/move Standard), casual chess evenings, and fun chess nights. The youth club plays regular 6 week tournaments. The time control will be 25 minutes + 5 seconds per move for White, Orange, Green, & Blue sections. There are no clocks for the White section. If a game is not finished after 30 minutes, a clock with a 5-minute time control will be added.
